  <h3><b>Legacy Payments Methods</b></h3>
  <p><b>Cheques</b></p>
  <p>&#34Percent of the payments formats targeted by criminals were in the form of checks.&#34</p>
  <p>Checks are by far the most popular form of fraudulent payment causing many businesses to ban there use for customer to business transactions.</p>
  <p>However they are still used for small business to business transactions  of supplies of minor services.</p>
  <p>Security Measures: </p>
    <li>Watermarks</li>
    <li>Serial numbers</li>
  <p>However it is difficult to prevent as many forms of fraud are either authentic checks that will &#39bounce&#39 or stolen checks that are being used with a forged signature.</p>
  <p><b>Physical Cash</b></p>
  <p>&#34In 2009, Bank of England figures revealed 566,000 counterfeit notes in the UK. Of these, 95% were twenty pound notes. So just one note in every 5,000 was a fake&#34.</p>
  <p>&#34The most common fraud is of one pound coins. There are some 30-40 million in circulation, so about 2.8% of the total are fakes.&#34</p>
  <p>Security Methods:</p>
    <li>Physical composition (Coins and notes)</li>
    <li>Micro weaving</li>
	<li>Micro printing</li>
    <li>Serial numbers</li>
	<li>Holograms</li>
  
      
  <h3><b>Current Security</b></h3>
  <p>The first and easily the oldest method of payment is paying with physical cash. There are multiple checks and measures in place to ensure that businesses are secure from any kind of fraudulent payments or robbery.   </p>
  <p>The first measure is the use of micro printing. This is a technique which involves printing microscopic messages onto the cash notes. The purpose of these microscopic messages is that they will blur when a note is copied meaning under microscope it will be seen to be fake.  </p>
  <p>Another measure is the paper the note is printed on. It is made up of a special combination of cotton and linen fibres giving it a unique texture that can be checked to ensure a note authenticity. Also special patterns are woven into certain parts of authentic bank notes to make it even harder to copy a bank note. </p>
  <p>Another measure is the ink that is used to create the text and images on the notes. The pigment used is of a very specific composition making it hard to replicate. Also it special proprieties making the colour change depending the angle you look at the note. </p>
  <p>All these features combined with others such as fine-line printing and security strips make physical cash very hard to duplicate and therefore defraud. </p>
  <p>Another form of physical payment is to use cheques. Cheques are much less secure for businesses than paying in cash. This is because the only security mark on the cheque is special designs or watermarks printed on the backs of cheques. These however are easily copied, meaning that it is up to the recipient to inspect the cheques and possibly ring the writer bank to authenticate the cheque. </p>
  <p>An ever increasingly popular method of payment is by credit card and debit card. Both type of cards can be used both online and physically in store. There first line of defence is a simple chip and pin. This means that every card will have a chip implanted in it. This chip is used to uniquely identify each card. When a transaction is requested the card is identified on a main secure database. Then the user is asked to input a unique 4 digit pin number. This is used to ensure that the user of the card is its registered owner.  </p>
  <p>Then the request is authenticated and checked against the relevant banks databases. The data being send to the bank will be encrypted usually with a 128-bit encryption. This is designed to prevent hackers from incepting packets of data to access the private information stored.  </p>
  <p>Also while using the card online more data is required to authenticate the card. Typically the user will have to input there full card number as well as the CVV number located on the back of the card. </p>
  <p>Many card companies also offer extra levels of security such as MasterCards SecureCodeTM or VistaTM verification (also known as 3D secure).  </p>
  <p>Also many banks will have dedicated staff to monitor for unusual transactions or strange spending patterns. They then have to power to ban any further transactions using this card until the owner can be contacted and the purchases verified.  </p>
  <p>A final security measure is the use of personal card readers. These are used when a customer is looking to set up any form of direct bank transfer or start a direct debit. The users respective bank will send a code to input into the card reader to start the process. Then the user will insert there card and input there pin. Then a code will be generated to be inputted on the banks website. This multi code system ensures that there is a high level of security.  </p>
  <p>A new use of some credit and debit cards is the ability to use contactless payment. This is where the card may simply be placed on a card reader and the transaction in automatically completed. This technology is less secure and is does not require the user to know the pin linked to that card. This is mediated by the fact that this form of payment typically is not allowed to be performed on large payments and the fact that most card holder will report there card stolen or lost before it can be fraudulently used. This form of payment uses the same online encryption as regular card. </p>
  <h3><b>Future Security</b></h3>
  <p> Contactless is the newest from of payment only becoming available in 2007.</p>
  <p>Most banks now provide contactless credit and debit cards. Also there are mobile contactless systems such as Apple Pay, Google Wallet and Yoyo.</p>
  <p>Security Measures:</p>
  <li>Same secure encryption and storage of data as Card payments</li>
    <li>The card reader has to be between 2-4 inches of the card</li>
    <li>A single transaction limit of &pound20</li>
  </ul>
