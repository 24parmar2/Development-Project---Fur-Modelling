  <h3><b>Bitcoin (And deriritives)</b></h3>
  <p>Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency, that is created and held electronically. Coins are generated by &#34Miners&#34, who use their computers in order to solve mathematical problems which then produce a coin. </p>
  <p>Bitcoin is decentralised in that no central authority controls it. Which means, that no single person or entity can tinker or alter the network. Theoretically resulting in a more stable currency than traditional currency. </p>
  
  <br><img src="bitcoingraph.png" class="w3-hover-opacity" alt="bitcoingraph" width="50%"></br>
  <p>However, bitcoin is incredibly volatile, in 2010 a single bitcoin was worth just 20 cents. Rising to a single bitcoin being worth over 970 dollars in late 2013, before dropping down again. This means that Laszlo Hanyecz, a bitcoin user who paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas, which at the time was worth $25, is now worth over $5.12 million, and at bitcoins all-time high, that many bitcoins would be worth $11.47 million. </p>
  <p>Being so volatile, I do not believe that bitcoin is yet ready for general use my the public, in that you could lose the majority of your money in a very short space of time. (Of course, the inverse is also true, you could earn a lot of money by investing in bitcoin and then selling them back and converting to USD when the market is at a high)</p>
  <h3><b>Android pay</b></h3>
  <p>A payment method instead of a currency type, android pay is Googles solution to apple pay, and replaces google wallet on smartphones. </p>
  <p>Android pay allows the user to pay for goods using their smartphone, it works much like contactless cards that are already in circulation. </p>
  <p>Interestingly, android pay does not use the actual card details that the user supplies when a transaction is made, instead, it generates a virtual account number which represents the user&#39s information. This should help to keep the user more secure as instead of sending their information, a one-time code is being sent, which does not contain any of the uses actual information. </p>
  <h3><b>Apple pay</b></h3>
  <p>Apple pay works in much the same way as android pay, and has a similar security system.</p>
  <h3><b>M-Pesa</b></h3>
  <p>The world&#39s most expansive mobile payments scheme, set up in Kenya, with help from the United Kingdom department of international development. This system has nearly 15 million users who use their mobile phones to deposit cash. &#34Money&#34 Is sent by via text message. </p>
  <p>A third of Kenya&#39s GDP flows now flows through M-Pesa.</p>
  <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
  <p>I believe that the currency of the future will continue to become more decentralised, as people move away from centralised banks and currency systems.  </p>
  <p>I also believe that the way that many people pay for goods will change, a large shift appears to be happening away from Chip & Pin devices, to contactless devices, including contactless cards, and contactless payments involving electronic devices, such as smartphones and smart watches.  </p>
  <p>However, safety, security and anonymity are an issue with any future currency, and it is doubtful that any future currency or payment method is likely to be able to hold up to the same standard as old fashioned cash. </p>
  <p>A study by the centre for economics and business research in London agrees with this viewpoint. It believes that, from 9.3% of all transactions today, non-card non cash payments will more than double to 19.6% by 2019. These payment methods include mobile payments and online payment methods such as PayPal.  </p>
  <p>The study also shows that security was one of the most important factors in deciding which payment method to use. With more than half of people surveyed indicating that security was the most important factor. </p>
  <p>It is also stated, that younger people are driving forward the market away from traditional cash and cards into more modern methods such as mobile payments. Consumers outside of the 18-24 age range have used their mobile phone to make payments 32% of the time, whereas 46% of consumers aged 18-24 have used their mobile phones to make payments. 27% of consumers aged 18-24 stated that they would never make a purchase using their smartphone. </p>
  <p>Interestingly, over half of surveyed consumers stated that a reduced risk of fraud, or increased security was their most important factor for new payment methods. This means that companies who are proposing future payment methods, such as Apple, Google, and Samsung will need to prove to consumers that using their methods is safe and secure, and possibly more secure than using a debit / credit card.  </p>
